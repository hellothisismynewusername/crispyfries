__Crispy Fries__ (Compiled, statically typed programming language)
- 
This programming language takes influence from many different languages, and provides a unique feel and experience with its hybrid postfix/infix syntax.
See "epic_programming_guide.md" for more info.
See the examples in the `examples` folder.

To build, do `cargo build`. When running this compiler, input the file name of the code you want compiled, and it will output a file `out.ll` that can be further processed or linked with other `.ll`s with llvm.
