add these to epic programming guide:
	(new) while
	malloc
	pointers
	puts
	sizeof
	char literals
	@ (GEP)
	& (deref)
	<- (assign value to location specified by pointer)
	functions
	dec
	forth stuff

mention that you should never name your variables the same thing, even across functions, so linking seperate modules will be needed... unless they're the same type. but just try to avoid it anyhow.

typecastkng

forthy features:
	if thar keeps the stack
	looping inside a do that keeps the stack
	forth words?

update std

built-in linking where you can import and itll add the decs you use

priv funcs (mqybe ez?)
