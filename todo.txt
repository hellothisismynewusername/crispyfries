add these to epic programming guide:
	while
	malloc
	pointers
	puts
	sizeof
	char literals
	@ (GEP)
	& (deref)
	<- (assign value to location specified by pointer)
	functions

check if there's some operators that don't consume / should consume items.

puts does not consume the last item. this is a feature, mention it.

mention that you should never name your variables the same thing, even across functions, so linking seperate modules will be needed
